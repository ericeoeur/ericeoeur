# Project 1: Jeopardy!
## Overview

For my first project in General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive, I created a Jeopardy! game that tests the user’s knowledge on an array of topics. As a Jeopardy! fan, I was particularly excited to create this game. 

**Live Site:** https://ericeoeur.github.io/jeopardy/index.html

Upon opening the Jeopardy! game site, the user will read a short description of the game. When ready, the user can click the “Start Game” button which will begin the game and the timer. The user will have two minutes to answer as many multiple choice questions as possible. The game board features six categories and six question price points ranging from $200 to $1000 dollars. The higher the dollar amount, the more difficult the question becomes. If a user answers a question incorrectly or skips the question, the amount that question is worth will be deducted from your total earnings/score. 

Once the timer is up, the score will be displayed to the user. If the user has a positive value, a modal will congratulate the user. If the score is in the negative, the modal will tell the user that have lost the game. Users may choose to replay the game after the two minutes are up.
